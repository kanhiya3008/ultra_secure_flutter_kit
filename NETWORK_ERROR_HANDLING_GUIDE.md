# Network Error Handling Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive solutions for handling network errors in the Ultra Secure Flutter Kit, specifically addressing the `PaisaNetworkException` and other common network connectivity issues.

## PaisaNetworkException Analysis

### Error Details
```
PaisaNetworkException (
  google.internal.paisa.v1.notification.PaisaFrontendNotificationService.FetchNotificationMessageByHandle,
  message: Exception in BidirectionalStream: net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED, 
  ErrorCode=1, 
  InternalErrorCode=-105, 
  Retryable=false,
  networkErrorType: NetworkErrorType.noNetworkConnection,
  code: 14
)
```

### Root Cause
The `PaisaNetworkException` is a Google service error that occurs when:
- DNS resolution fails (`net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`)
- The app cannot resolve domain names to IP addresses
- Google Play Services cannot connect to Google's notification service
- Network connectivity issues prevent proper DNS resolution

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Check Internet Connection
- Verify WiFi/mobile data is enabled
- Test connection with other apps
- Try switching between WiFi and mobile data

### 2. Restart Network Services
- Turn off WiFi/mobile data for 10 seconds
- Turn network services back on
- This clears DNS cache and resolves temporary issues

### 3. Clear DNS Cache
**Android:**
- Go to Settings > Network & Internet > WiFi
- Tap on your WiFi network > Advanced
- Select "Reset to factory defaults"

**iOS:**
- Go to Settings > General > Reset
- Select "Reset Network Settings"

### 4. Update Google Play Services
- Open Google Play Store
- Search for "Google Play Services"
- Update to the latest version
- Clear Google Play Services cache

### 5. VPN/Proxy Issues
- Disable VPN or proxy temporarily
- Some VPNs interfere with Google services
- Test without VPN to isolate the issue

## Advanced Solutions

### 1. DNS Configuration
Change DNS servers to:
- **Google DNS:** 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
- **Cloudflare DNS:** 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1

### 2. Firewall/Antivirus
- Check if firewall blocks Google services
- Temporarily disable antivirus
- Add app to firewall exceptions

### 3. Network Reset
**Last resort option:**
- Resets all network settings
- Removes saved WiFi passwords
- Use only if other solutions fail

## Implementation in Flutter App

### Network Error Handler
The app includes a comprehensive network error handling system:

```dart
// Handle network operations with automatic retry
final result = await context.handleNetworkOperation(
  operation: () => yourNetworkCall(),
  maxRetries: 3,
  retryDelay: Duration(seconds: 2),
);
```

### Network Status Monitoring
```dart
// Monitor network connectivity
NetworkConnectivityWidget(
  onConnectionRestored: () => showSuccessMessage(),
  onConnectionLost: () => showErrorMessage(),
  child: YourApp(),
)
```

### Error Dialog
```dart
// Show user-friendly error dialog
NetworkErrorHandler.showNetworkErrorDialog(
  context,
  NetworkErrorInfo.fromException(exception),
  onRetry: () => retryOperation(),
);
```

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Proactive Network Monitoring
- Monitor network status continuously
- Show connection status to users
- Provide immediate feedback on connectivity changes

### 2. Graceful Degradation
- Implement offline mode when possible
- Cache critical data locally
- Queue operations for when connection is restored

### 3. Retry Logic
- Implement exponential backoff
- Limit retry attempts
- Provide user feedback during retries

### 4. Error Logging
- Log network errors for debugging
- Include error context and user actions
- Monitor error patterns

## Testing Network Errors

### 1. Simulate Network Issues
- Enable airplane mode
- Disconnect WiFi
- Use network throttling tools

### 2. Test Error Handling
- Use the "Test Error" button in the app
- Verify error dialogs appear correctly
- Test retry functionality

### 3. Monitor Performance
- Check app performance during network issues
- Ensure UI remains responsive
- Verify error recovery works properly

## Common Error Types

| Error Type | Description | Solution |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `noNetworkConnection` | No internet access | Check WiFi/mobile data |
| `dnsResolutionFailed` | Cannot resolve domains | Clear DNS cache, change DNS servers |
| `timeout` | Request timed out | Increase timeout, check network speed |
| `serverError` | Server-side issue | Retry later, check service status |
| `sslError` | SSL/TLS issues | Update certificates, check date/time |

## Best Practices

### 1. User Experience
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Include troubleshooting steps
- Offer retry options when appropriate

### 2. Error Recovery
- Implement automatic retry with backoff
- Gracefully handle partial failures
- Preserve user data during errors

### 3. Monitoring
- Track error frequency and patterns
- Monitor user impact of network issues
- Alert on critical network failures

### 4. Documentation
- Document common error scenarios
- Provide troubleshooting guides
- Keep error messages up to date
